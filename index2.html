                    <p>I have a foundational understanding of DBMS (Database Management Systems) and have worked on various projects that have allowed me to gain practical experience. While my knowledge in DBMS may not be at an advanced level, I am comfortable working with the core concepts and principles of database management. I have designed and created basic databases using SQL (Structured Query Language) and have implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data effectively. I am familiar with fundamental database concepts such as tables, relationships, and normalization. Additionally, I have worked with popular relational database management systems such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Although I am still in the process of expanding my expertise in DBMS, I am enthusiastic about further developing my skills and exploring more advanced topics, such as query optimization and database administration. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement in the field of DBMS.</p>
